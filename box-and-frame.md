# Box and frame

### Definition

Box is [semi-abstract](axiomatizing-concept.md#semi-abstracts) mathematical object, which can contains other objects. Box itself, should not be treated as a separate object with special and unique set of properties. It's purpose is to create something **referenceable**, which can provide positive or negative answer to the questionable existence functor. In other words, an object, from which the context can be inferred.

It's kinda the idea, of a frame, inside of which some objects exists, but frame itself doesn't contain any properties. At this point, You should ask yourself, question "Why do I need this new box object instead the frame?".

1. Box is a semi-abstract and should be thought of as a higher order object than a frame.
2. There is no box, that can not be considered a frame object, when needed
3. Box can contain infinite amount of other frames.
4. **Box can have size when needed!**
5. If context regards asking about hierarchical relation, there frame should be used.
6. If context doesn't require an answer regarding the hierarchy of elements in a structure, we should use box object&#x20;
