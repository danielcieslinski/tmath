# Intro

I introduce bunch of novel formal concepts, in the first place, phenomenal thinking frameworks, that I created during last two years, when I travel a long hard road, from, through and to the noise, trying to find out what the totality is.

### Restoring lost purpose in science

The purpose is to establish _mathematics ov thought._, where formalisms are tools, for expressing and sharing ideas, on the contrary to how it looks now, that is, creating formalisms, which later lead only to losing the initial idea and purpose, among valid expressions, belonging to the system. I like to call this dystopian phenomenon by the term `formal symbolism`

What I consider to be the direct cause, is putting focus on what objects are instead of what they can become.

### Thought box

* Formal correctness is the exterminating angel of recent science.&#x20;

**General ideas**

* Mathematical objects instead of having fixed form, are more of a templates, which can be used for description of some phenomena. The most important is the idea, that we want to present. Idea is of the highest value, then we pick proper tools. That is theorems.
* Formality is a property of mathematical object, entirely dependent on the meaning provider.
* Definition, comes with default properties and relations of the defined object
* Every object, has size
* Everything that exists, indicates e of a scope, within this object maintains its' identity.
* The biggest scope is totality&#x20;
* Proof is source of truth in the domain of blind. No need to prove, when you don't forget the rules, you define
