# Godmaking

I introduce bunch of novel formal concepts, in the first place, phenomenal thinking frameworks,
that I created during last two years, when I travel a long hard road, from, through and to the noise, trying to find out what totality is.

__Name comes from: Generators, Objects, Deffer.__
Those are primers that formal object must distinguish to maitain, "mathmaking" capabilities.


#### General ideas
 - Mathematical objects instead of having fixed form, are more of a templates, which can be used for description of some phenomena. The most important is the idea, concept, which we want to present. 
 - Formality is a property of mathematical object, entirely dependent on the meaning provider.
 - Naming 
 - Definition, comes with default properties and relations of the defined object
 - Every object, has size
 - Everything that exists, indicates existance of a scope, within this object maintains its' identity.
 - The biggest scope is totality $\Omega_T^{T}$. 
 - Proof is source of truth in the domain of blind. No need to prove, when you don't forget the rules, you define
