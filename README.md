# Godmaking

Bunch of formal concepts, in the first place phenomenal thinking frameworks of my authorship. 
Created during last two years, being for me a long hard road, from, through and to the noise. 

## General ideas
 - Mathematical objects instead of having fixed form, are more of a templates, which can be used for description of some phenomena. The most important is the idea, concept, which we want to present. 
 - Formality is a property of mathematical object, entirely dependent on the meaning provider.
 - Definition, comes with default properties and relations of the defined object
 - Every object, has size
 - Everything that exists, indicates existance of a scope, within this object mintains identity.
