# Intro

_Bunch of formal concepts and theorems, but in the first place phenomenal thinking frameworks of my authorship, which I've created during last two years, being a long hard road, from, through and to the (information)noise._

**Name origin**: _Thought_ + _Math_

I hope to establish _Mathematics ov thought_. Formal methods, where in the first place comes always **idea**, or a **concept,** while formality comes from a need to unify the meaning, among different meaning providers.

### Principles

* **All is dual \[...] and up to it's anti-auto-morphism.**
* **More than what objects are, important is what they can and can not become.**
* **Everything can be comparable.**

### Get involved

### At the moment

Repository is in very active development, sorry for the mess and a lot of unclarity, redundancy and imprecision. I'm bring here all my mathematical ideas, from last years and unifying them, in order to make sure **tmath** maintains full integrity, as the thinking framework and the meta-theoretic formal system.
