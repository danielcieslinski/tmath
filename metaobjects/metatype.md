# Metatype

### Unit principle

With no loss of generality, everything is information. For the sake of meta-unification, I embrace that **metatype** is _**information**_. Smallest amount of information is _**unit.**_ Everything that exists, concerns not null amount of information. Everything is comparable, by amount of **information** it concerns.&#x20;

### Meta-philosophy

**Metatype** in the most common _type_ object in the sense of the triple`(f x y)<MT> = (input-information, transformation, output-information)(`<mark style="color:blue;">`•`</mark>`)`

_Transformation_ is computation. Every computation, just as its' specification(_code_ for example) holds type closure, over the _metatype._

{% hint style="info" %}
`(`<mark style="color:blue;">`•`</mark>`)`Denotes auto-reference to this triple specification
{% endhint %}
