# The making of T

## Purity of T within the realizer

Identity of representation of T-generating element, in a system, with invariant representation transformation, must involve additional information, allowing for distinguishing the generative element, from first step of the generative process. I'm assuming here, my PR principle. Principle of system design, which is to always consider creating an element allowing us to be able to defer the pure idea of the system, when inside of the system <==> (g)enerator.

**In other words, something that allows, for emergence of h-cobordism, from its anti-auto-morphism.**

Imagine you're sitting inside a ball. In order to remember where you are you make a square and draw π in it's center. Wherever inside a ball it allows you to recall, that it's exactly anti-concept of a ball, shape, equality and your position ;)

## Metatuple

Every non-formal (non binary comparable), concept can be iteratively transformed to formal using the meta tuple \[•, ¡]. For every anti-operator in generative expression, there is entangled existence operator. Let's say, there is a rule, that from beginning tuple, we write anti operator always on the right side

```
// (•) represents the existence functor. 
// (¡) represent the anti-operator.

--- Metatuple

mt = [•,¡]

---

[•¡]
(•)[•,¡](¡)

-- Step -- 
(•) [•!] [•¡] v (¡)

--- From here ghosting the front existance operator and the metatuple ---
(•!)v(¡)
(V)(T)(g)
(Value)(Type)(generator)

// v(¡) denotes Type, which is Value of the anti operator

// Therefore T0 is "value" of anti-operator, 
// which is boolean `not`. The value of anti-operator: v(¡) is a generator, 
// to the boolean logic, that is T1, which contains two object of same type,
// but not the same, which are simply two values. #true #false
// which are denoted in the step by [•!]
```
