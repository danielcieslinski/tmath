#### How big is a game?

**Idea**

From every point in a system, deterministic computation of system dimensionality, where dimensionality is natural number, with deterministic step \[n] -> \[n+1] can be computed with quantum algorithm, n=QO(dim(N))

#### Concept identity

identity(x):= f(x) -> ø

&#x20;difference(x,y) := ð(x,y) => o

```
// example
g(x) = 0 
2(π
  === x(f) = 0
x(g) = 0

 [•, ¡]
```

#### Metatuple

Every non-formal (non binary comparable), concept can be iteratively transformed to formal using the meta tuple \[•, ¡].

(•) represents the existance functor. (¡) represent the anti-operator.

For every antioperator in generative expression, there is entangled existance operator. Let's say, there is a rule, that from beggining tuple, we write anti operator always on the right side.

> Why goddamit there is still no software where I can easily remap keys, and also let everyone else, who would like to use same convention, easily import same key combination in any place. For this are the metatheorems so that they can be used to easily represent every concept, with no loss of generality. This is just grotesque, that $e^{\pi \* i} = -1$ is considered to be the greatest theorem ever, while hardly useful in any case, cuz is either responsible, for problems emerging by approximating identity element, with inf series, or general collapse of the idea. $i = sqrt(-1)$ is the paper town of mathematics. semi-greatest prank in the history of human intelligence.

Besides.

#### Producing T-function

```
g = [•,¡]
```

#### Theorem

Identity of representation of T-generating element, in a system, with invariant representation transformation, must involve additional information, allowing for distinguishment the generative element, from first step of the generative process. I'm assuming here, my PR principle. Principle od system design, which is to always be able to recognize, the pure idea of the system, when inside the system <==> (g)enerator.

That is: Something that allows, for emergence of h-cobordism, from its' anti-auto-morphism.

Imagine you're sitting inside a ball. In order to remeber where you are you make a square and draw π in it's center. Wherever inside a ball it allows you to recall, that it's exactly anti-concept of a ball, shape, equality and your position ;)

#### Copy functor

Given that representation system of the generative element, stays invariant for the time of producing T-function we can say there is a procedure pi(g), which first step is transition of the element between the (concept, realiser) domains.

Using the idea of contextulized descriptor. We can wnlog say:

g=ctx(e) != g

functor (C), which when applied to generative element, produces pure T-function. Giv

```
idea of existstance inside anty system:
  Law 0: ð(idea, thing) => g=(element, repr(idea)) | g is hyper outlier value in a set where there is centroid(probability, and avg function)

 :[g](0~1)

(pi,[•!]) -> g_pure -> 

in every sytem 

g,  = repr<•>

def pi(g):


//
o = "•¡"
```
