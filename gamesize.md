### How big is a game?
#### Idea
From every point in a system, deterministic computation of system
dimensionality, where dimensionality means, deterministic step [n] -> [n+1]
can be computed with n=Q(N)

Information in common understanding is triple.
(input information, transformation, output information)


transformation of information 

CI => I'

There is quantum algorithm being exactly n=O(n) which allows to determine 


### Concept identity

identity(x):= f(x) -> ø
difference(x,y) := ð(x,y) => o

```
// example
  [•, ¡] (either[f(x) -> ø, f:=ð ] ] )

```

### Metatuple

Every non-formal (non binary comparable), concept can be iteratively transformed to formal using the meta tuple [•, ¡].

(•) represents the existance functor.
(¡) represent the anti-operator. 

For every antioperator in generative expression, there is entangled existance
operator. Let's say, there is a rule, that from beggining tuple, we write anti
operator always on the right side. 

> To make it easier to write for existance operator I'll denote as 'a' and anti
operator as 'b'.

### Producing T-function 

```
g = [•,¡]
```

### Theorem

Identity of representation of T-generating element, in a system, 
with invariant representation transformation, must involve additional
information, allowing for distinguishment the generative element, from first step
of the generative process. I'm assuming here, my PR principle. 
Principle od system design, which is to always be able to recognize, the pure
idea of the system, when inside the system <==> (g)enerator. 

That is: Something that allows, for emergence of h-cobordism, from its'
anti-auto-morphism.

Imagine you're sitting inside a ball. In order to remeber where you are you
make a square and draw π in it's center. Wherever inside a ball it allows you
to recall, that it's exactly anti-concept of a ball, shape, equality and your
position ;)


### Copy functor

Given that representation system of the generative element, stays invariant for the time of producing T-function
we can say there is a procedure pi(g), which first step is transition of the
element between the (concept, realiser) domains.

Using the idea of contextulized descriptor. We can wnlog say:

g=ctx(e) != g



functor (C), which when applied to generative
element, produces pure T-function. Giv


```
idea of existstance inside anty system:
  Law 0: ð(idea, thing) => g=(element, repr(idea)) | g is hyper outlier value in a set where there is centroid(probability, and avg function)

 :[g](0~1)

(pi,[•!]) -> g_pure -> 

in every sytem 

g,  = repr<•>

def pi(g):


//
o = "•¡"

```
•¡
[••][¡¡]


  •[•,¡]¡

```
