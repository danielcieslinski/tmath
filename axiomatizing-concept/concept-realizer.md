- Concept exists 

- There isn't any concept which does not belong to the Concept-space.

- Concept-space has no size.


Every descriptor is quering function on the concept space, yet every
descriptor, which does not have perfect realizer, entagles nondetermistic
error. Perfect realizer exists only if the concept, descriptor is 'pure',
belongs to the space with no-fact.
