# Gates

### Purpose

Handy symbolic clarification of numerical expression in all numerical system. Gate is simply the base of the numerical system.

### Gate notation

$$n[g]$$denotes a gate. In decimal system gate is denotes as $$n[5*2]$$. Using polish reverse notation$$n[2*2+1*2]$$.

Using additionally the operator language: $$n[*+*]$$is a gate of decimal numeric system. I'll later describe in more detailed way, how to convert from standard notation being something like $$10^n$$ into presented here, gated notation. $$\overline{g}(...)$$is a gating function, or glueing function. It takes arguments, and glues them with the assigned gate. $$ǥ:= n[*+*] | \overline{g}(a,b,...)$$ denotes a gating function, with a gate for decimal numerical system.

### Example

$$ǥ(1,2,3) = 123_{10}$$

### Operator language

It's&#x20;
