# Trascendence operator

Transcendence operator is such operator, which returns a tuple containing objects of same order, for any algebraic structure with elements, that taxonomic properties <==> elements belong to two or more disjoint sets, where every set for all their elements satisfies inequality relation, for specified inequality relation, where specification can is given, as the inequality relation, between the edges starting from the common point.

### Example

Let's for take this diagram for example.

In this case, given inequality relation&#x20;

&#x20;X and Y. all(Y) > X. For example in standard algebras, those are operators and numbers. Every algebraic expression can be said to be a form of `[x][fx]+`
