# God principle

**Name origin: Generators + Objects + Deffers.** This is the [**triplet**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplet) that every mathematical object must be _morphable to_, in order to be considered having _mathmatking_ capabilities.&#x20;

**Definition of definition:** Extension of the totality box, by the object, to which the given descriptor provides its' identity.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Pay attention here, not to mix up the terms totality box, with the concept hilbert space. You can assume, that those terms, have absolutely nothing to do with each other.

### Purity

Purity of a concept, is given by the absence of absolute(context-free) existence functor.  Pure concept is formal concept that has perfect realizer, however purity is term reserved strictly to its' concept and not the realizer. In fact impurity is property of every realizer <==> there is no realizer that is pure. Can be thought of as the prolog program, which contains only set of rules, but no facts at all.
