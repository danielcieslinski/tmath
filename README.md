# Intro

_Bunch of formal concepts and theorems, but in the first place phenomenal thinking frameworks of my authorship, which I've created during last two years, being a long hard road, from, through and to the (information)noise._

_Main purpose behind this work is to develop tools capable of unifying all branches of mathematics, while at the same time not restraining mathematical freedom._

**Name origin**: _T_ + _Math_\
_Where you can assume T is because of meta-T function around which, most of the introduced concepts revolve, however It's also tribute to a **thought,** which ironically seems to me somehow lost in the modern mathematics. Stuck somewhere in between the machine-math, formal gibberish and unintuitive notation._

In the long run I hope to establish, what I got to call, the _mathematics ov thought_. The collection of formal methods, where in the first place comes always the **idea**, or a **concept,** which does not need sufficient prior and complete formalization. Instead, formality comes rather at the property of the system, emerging from the need to unify meaning, among different meaning providers.

I hereby present several ideas and tricks which allow for \`continuous development\` of the formalisms, which are necessary to call something 'formal', however at the same time not being invalid mathematical object without complete formal specification.

### The Meta Principle

<mark style="background-color:blue;">**All is dual \[...] and up to its anti-auto-morphism.**</mark>



### Some ideas

* **Proof is a source of truth in a domain of blind.**
* **Everything is comparable, the trick is to pick a metric.**
* **Every object has its' identity**

### At the moment

Repository is in very active development, sorry for the mess and a lot of unclarity, redundancy and imprecision. I'm bring here all my mathematical ideas, from last years, optimizing and unifying them, in order to make sure **Tmath** maintains full integrity, as the thinking framework and possibly minimalistic, yet extremely powerful meta-formal system.
