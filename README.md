# Intro

_Bunch of formal concepts and theorems, but in the first place phenomenal thinking frameworks of my authorship, which I've created during last two years, being a long hard road, from, through and to the (information)noise._

**Name origin**: _Thought_ + _Math_

I hope to establish _Mathematics ov thought_. Formal methods, where in the first place comes always **idea**, or a **concept,** while formality comes from a need to unify the meaning, among different meaning providers.

### Principles

* **All is dual ... and up to it's anti-auto-morphism**

### Get involved

* [https://github.com/danielcieslinski/tmath/discussions](https://github.com/danielcieslinski/tmath/discussions)
* [https://github.com/danielcieslinski/tmath/issues](https://github.com/danielcieslinski/tmath/issues)

### At the moment

Repository is in very active development, sorry for the mess and a lot of unclarity, redundancy and imprecision. I'm bring here all my mathematical ideas, from last years and unifying them, in order to make sure tmath maintains full integrity, as the thinking framework and the meta-theoretic formal system.
