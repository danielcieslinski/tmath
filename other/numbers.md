# Numbers

Numbers are [concept](../axiomatizing-concept.md#axioms-of-concept) and every concept has it's identity. Given algebraic non-linearity, which arises from linear isomorphic hierarchical expansion, for each algebraic structure there emerges duality, between the objects, which when both [outscoped](../outscoping.md) to the common outer structure, must have common non-null-defer. Existence of this defer, is a [primer](../3-pr.md#primer) to the symmetric defer, upon the law of distinguishment and non-equivalence of their source algebras.
