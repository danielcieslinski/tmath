# Generators

Generator of typed structure S is element of higher order. In other words, element can be considered a generator of typed structure of $$S[T_{n}]$$ only if there can exist structure of higher order, and that would take exactly one rewrite rule, for all it's elements, to --d  such that the  where element of type \[Tx+1]. &#x20;

$$
\forall_{x \in X} |g(x)=ø
$$

### Identity

An element, can be considered a generator of structure S, only when all objects, belonging to that structure, can be said to be have uniform type T and only when there can exist a hypothetical structure of higher order, than S

### Generator of natural numbers

Generator of $$N_{+}$$is $$(-)$$, because $$\forall_{n} -(n) = ø$$, this is to be interpreted, simply as an algebraic expression $$\forall_{n \in N_{+}}| n-n=0$$.&#x20;

### Primer to symmetry

Generator of structure S is such object, which if contained in its' structure would be a primer to the symmetrical object which it generates.
