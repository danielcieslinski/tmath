# Copy functor

Given that representation system of the generative element, stays invariant for the time of producing T-function we can say there is a procedure pi(g), which first step is transition of the element between the (concept, realiser) domains.

Using the idea of contextulized descriptor. We can wnlog say:

`pi(ǥ) => e = mx != g`

functor (C), which when applied to generative element, produces pure T-function. Giv

```
idea of existstance inside anty system:
  Law 0: ð(idea, thing) => ǥ =(element, repr(idea)) | g is hyper outlier value in a set where there is centroid(probability, and avg function)

 :[g](0~1)

(pi,[•!]) -> g_pure

g, e = repr<•>
```
